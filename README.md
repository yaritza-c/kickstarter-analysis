## Overview of Project

Finding the percentages of goals during specific months.


### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the outcomes of the theater launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

In order to determine my analysis, I created 2 different sheets and charts. 
The first one contains the dates, parent category, and outcomes. This shows the outcomes
on the launch dates. How many failed, succeeded, and cancelled in specific months. The 
second one consists of the percentages based on goals. When finding the percentages, I kept getting an error
with the function that I was using. I had to input the functions in various ways until
I found the one that worked and made sense.

## Results

- Two conclusions I can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are:
-- The month of May has the highest successful outcomes with it also being the highest fails

-- The month of December is the lowest successful outcomes with November being the lowest fails

- What I have concluded on the Outcome based goals is that the lowest goal has the highest percentage of success, and the highest goal has the least successful.

- Some limitations of this dataset are that this could have been broken down by a week or even days to receive more adequate information.

- Some other possible table and/or graph we could have created are box, bar, and/or column.
